Final Trade Plan — Galaxy Digital (GLXY)

1. Trade Type
   Speculative, directional long (swing/trend). Treat as high-volatility allocation.

2. Thesis (Condensed)
   GLXY is a leveraged equity proxy to a crypto upcycle (trading gains, AUM fees, principal BTC exposure) with optionality from Helios (AI/HPC revenue). Upside driven by BTC/ETH institutional flows and Helios milestones; downside driven by crypto drawdowns, regulatory rulings, or Helios execution failure.

3. Entry Strategy (Tiered + Breakout)
   Primary pullback entries (scale-in):

* Tranche 1 (Aggressive): $25.00–$26.50 — buy 30% of intended position when GLXY dips into zone and daily shows stabilization (hammer/bullish engulfing, or RSI improving).

* Tranche 2 (Core): $26.50–$28.00 — buy additional 40% if price remains/consolidates in zone with support confirmed on 1–2 day closes.

* Tranche 3 (Confirmation): Add remaining 30% on confirmation: daily close > 50-day MA or positive catalyst (earnings beat, Helios milestone, strong BTC move).

Alternate breakout entry (momentum):

* Buy on daily close above $35.00 with volume > 1.25x 30-day average. Use smaller initial size and add on follow-through.

* Hard alternative for conservative buyers: wait for confirmed recovery above $32–$34 area (range resistance turned support) before entering.

4. Stops & Risk Controls

* Hard stop (structural): $22.00 (your example). Use this if you want a simple rule tied to change in market structure.

* Volatility stop (percent): 12% below each tranche entry price (adjust to your volatility tolerance).

* Trailing stop on winners: once position up 20% from average entry, move stop to -10% trailing; at +40% tighten trailing to -8%.

* Use OCO (one-cancels-other) orders where possible: place entry limit + stop loss OCO to automate execution discipline.

5. Price Targets & R:R (Explicit)

* Short-term target (first take profit): $35.00 — close 30–50% of position if hit. R:R example: buy at $26 → target $35 = +34.6% (R:R ≈ 2.9:1 if stop at $22 → 15.4% risk).

* Medium-term target: $40.00 — close another 25–40% if thesis continues. Example: buy at $26 → $40 = +53.8%.

* Long-term stretch target: $45.00+ — hold remaining position for >6–12 months if crypto bull cycle accelerates and Helios executes. Example R:R from $26 to $45 = +73%.

* If using breakout entry at $35, use targets $40 (short), $45–50 (medium/long) with stops tightened to 8–12%.

6. Position Sizing (Example Math)

* Risk per trade: 1% of portfolio (conservative) to 2% (aggressive).

* Example: $100,000 portfolio, 1% risk = $1,000 max loss.

  * If using hard stop = $22 and entry avg = $26, per-share risk = $4 → position size = $1,000 / $4 = 250 shares → exposure ≈ 250 * $26 = $6,500 (6.5% of portfolio).

* Use scale-in so initial tranche is smaller: e.g., start with 30% of full position (~75 shares), second tranche 40% (~100 shares), third tranche 30% (~75 shares).

* Max initial portfolio exposure recommendation: 2–4% until core thesis is proven (Helios milestones, steady EBITDA improvement). Increase only as risk decreases.

7. Triggers to Enter / Add

* Enter / add on:

  * Price dips to $25–28 with bullish daily reversal and improving volume.

  * BTC up >8–10% on strong volume and GLXY showing RSI/relative strength improvement.

  * Positive company catalyst: Q3 beat, announced Helios construction milestone, announced customer/lease updates, insider buying.

* Avoid/add caution or exit on:

  * Regulatory enforcement action or negative ruling affecting staking/trading.

  * Helios delayed >6 months beyond communicated timelines or CoreWeave lease issues.

  * Material insider/institutional selling wave combined with poor liquidity.

  * Sustained downtrend in BTC/ETH (>15% drawdown with rising realized vol).

8. Exit Rules (Explicit)

* Stop triggered: exit full position (or tranche) if stop hit.

* Take profits as targets hit: sell partial per target tiers to lock gains.

* Time decay exit: if position sits in a thin range for >12 weeks and no positive developments, reduce exposure by at least 50%.

* Catalyst exit: trim/exit into positive run-up as fundamentals become priced, or immediately on severe negative news.

9. Monitoring Checklist (Before and After Entry)

* BTC/ETH direction and realized implied and realized volatility.

* Upcoming catalysts: earnings date, Helios updates, investor presentations.

* Volume confirmation on GLXY moves (compare to 20–40 day average).

* Insider and institutional 13D/13G/Form 4 filings.

* Balance sheet updates: BTC holdings, cash/stablecoin levels, AUM changes.

* Market micro (bid/ask spreads) and liquidity — widen stops if liquidity thin.

10. Sample Concrete Plan (One Example, $100k Portfolio, Risk = 1%)

* Target total allocation if trade fully scaled: 3% of portfolio = $3,000 exposure target.

* Risk cap per trade: $1,000.

* Entry plan: buy $975 at $26.00 (37.5 shares rounded to 37) as Tranche 1; set stop $22 → risk ≈ $4 * 37 ≈ $148. Add Tranche 2 and 3 if price moves into $26.50–$28 zone per rules to reach $3,000 exposure total.

* Take profits: 40% off at $35, next 30% at $40, hold remainder for $45+ with trailing stop.

11. Worst-Case Considerations & Sizing Conservatism

* Because GLXY’s NAV and earnings are highly sensitive to BTC, treat position size conservatively relative to other single-name holdings.

* If you are risk-averse to regulatory events, reduce position size by 50% or use options instead of stock to define risk.

12. Execution Tips & Order Types

* Use limit orders for entries at exact zones; use OCO to pair entry with stop.

* For scale-in, stagger limit orders across the zone (e.g., $25.50, $26.25, $27.50).

* Consider protective put options if available and liquid to cap downside while retaining upside (costly in high IV environment).

13. Quick Checklist Before Pressing Buy

* Confirm BTC direction/volatility (daily and weekly).

* Confirm no major negative headlines for GLXY in last 24–48 hours.

* Confirm volume is normal or improving on bounce.

* Confirm your stop, target, and position size math are set.

* Confirm you can tolerate a fast drawdown (GLXY can gap through stops in thin markets).

Why This Plan Is Better / Improvements Summary
