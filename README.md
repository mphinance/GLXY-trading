# GLXY Trade Alerts â€” Entry/Breakout/BTC Momentum

This Pine Script indicator is designed for the TradingView platform to provide visual and alert-based signals for trading GLXY, based on a combination of price action, volume, and Bitcoin (BTC) momentum.

## Features

* **Entry Zone:** A user-defined price range where the indicator will signal a potential entry opportunity if a bullish candle and rising Relative Strength Index (RSI) are present.

* **Breakout Zone:** A user-defined price range above which the indicator will signal a potential breakout. This signal is filtered by a volume multiplier to confirm strength.

* **Structural Stop:** A critical support level where a break below can trigger an alert, suggesting a potential exit.

* **Technical Indicators:** The script uses a Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a period of `14` to check for a rising trend. It also uses a Simple Moving Average (SMA) of volume over `20` periods as part of the volume filter.

* **BTC Momentum:** The script checks for a significant daily percentage change in BTC to provide an additional layer of confirmation for breakout signals.

* **Visuals:** The indicator plots horizontal lines for key levels and uses shaded zones to clearly highlight the Entry and Breakout zones on the chart. Upward and downward facing labels mark entry and breakout signals.
