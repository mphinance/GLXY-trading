Trading Strategy Rules: 21-Day Time Series Screening
Screen 1: EMA Cross Momentum
Captures fresh momentum when the 8 EMA crosses above the 21 EMA.
Fresh Breakouts (Day 1 to 3):
 * Entry: Above the breakout day's high with volume confirmation.
 * Stop: Below the breakout day's low (tight).
 * Target: Look for validation; if still on screen in 5 days, add to position.
 * Size: 50% position (unproven).
Sustained Momentum (Day 10+):
 * Entry: On pullbacks to the 21 EMA, not new breakouts.
 * Stop: Close below 21 EMA (The Tao Rule).
 * Target: Let it run. 19-day trends do not die quickly.
 * Size: 100% position (proven).
Screen 2: Gravity Squeeze
Captures high volume consolidation with minimal price movement (accumulation).
Single Day Gravity:
 * Action: Watch, do not trade.
 * Why: Unconfirmed; could be anything.
Multi-Day Gravity (3+ days):
 * Entry: Break above the multi-day range high (long) or below range low (short).
 * Stop: Opposite side of the range.
 * Target: Range height projected from breakout.
 * Size: 75% (directional bet after range breaks).
Conflicting Signals (Gravity + Bearish EMA):
 * Action: Wait; do not force the trade.
 * Watch: Does it resolve upside (gravity wins) or downside (bearish wins)?
 * Size down: If you must trade, 50% position max.
Screen 3: Volatility Squeeze
Captures extreme volatility compression (Bollinger Bands inside Keltner Channels).
Fresh Squeezes (Day 1 to 5):
 * Action: Add to watchlist, do not trade.
 * Why: Squeeze needs time to build energy.
Extended Squeezes (Day 15+):
 * Entry: When the squeeze FIRES (Bollinger Bands break outside Keltner Channels).
 * Direction: Trade the direction of the expansion, not your bias.
 * Stop: Opposite side of the squeeze range.
 * Size: LARGER than normal; long squeezes equal big moves.
Screen 4: Gamma Walls
Captures options market maker hedging levels (Call/Put Walls).
Fresh Gamma (Day 1 to 5):
 * Action: Monitor, do not trade.
 * Why: Wall levels may shift as positions are built.
Established Gamma (Day 10+):
 * Entry: Buy dips to put walls, sell rallies to call walls.
 * Stop: Significant break through the wall level (wait for confirmation).
 * Target: Opposite wall.
 * Size: 75% position.
Lifer Gamma (Day 20+):
 * Strategy: Sell premium; with walls this established, range-bound strategies work.
 * Trade bounces: High probability mean reversion.
 * Wait for breaks: If a wall breaks on volume, the move will be violent.
 * Size: 100% position on mean reversion plays.
Screen 5: Small Cap Multibaggers
Captures small caps with high gross margins and explosive revenue growth.
Entry Criteria:
 * Multiple quarters of consistent high growth (not a one-off).
 * Gross margin stable or expanding.
 * Reasonable valuation relative to growth rate.
Position Sizing:
 * Small caps require smaller positions (2% to 3% of portfolio max).
 * Scale in over time as the fundamental thesis proves out.
Risk Management:
 * These can go to zero; size accordingly.
 * Set thesis invalidation points (e.g., growth slows, margins compress).
Screen 6: Momentum with Pullback
Captures stocks in established uptrends pulling back to key support levels.
Valid Pullback (Prior 10+ days on Momentum Screens):
 * Entry: At support level (EMA touch, prior resistance becoming new support).
 * Stop: Below the support level.
 * Target: Prior highs, then trail.
 * Size: 100% (established trend).
Questionable Pullback (Short prior trend):
 * Entry: Wait for bounce confirmation.
 * Stop: Tighter than normal.
 * Size: 50% (less conviction).
Exhaustion Pullback (Dropped off screens after pullback):
 * Action: Do not trade.
 * Why: This is not a dip; it is the end of the move.
Screen 7: Bearish EMA Cross
Captures negative momentum shifts (8 EMA crossing below 21 EMA).
For Shorts:
 * Entry: Below the cross day's low.
 * Stop: Above recent swing high.
 * Target: Prior support levels.
 * Size: 50% (shorts are inherently harder than longs).
For Long Positions to Exit:
 * If your long holding appears here, tighten stops immediately.
 * If it stays on the bearish screen for 3+ days, consider closing the position entirely.
Conflicting with Other Screens:
 * Bearish EMA Cross + Gravity Squeeze: Ambiguous; wait for resolution.
 * Bearish EMA Cross + Bullish on another stock in sector: Sector rotation; sector context matters.
Screen 8: MEME & High IV Plays
Captures high retail interest, high short interest, and extreme options volatility.
Fresh MEME (Day 1 to 3):
 * Action: Small position only, or watch.
 * Why: Could fade tomorrow; unproven.
 * Size: 25% max position.
Sustained MEME (Day 10+):
 * Entry: On pullbacks within the trend.
 * Stop: Below key support (wider than normal).
 * Target: Scale out in chunks.
 * Size: 50% position.
MEME + Gamma Dual Validation:
 * Entry: Higher conviction setup.
 * Size: 75% position.
 * Logic: Retail AND institutions both see something.
Fading MEME (Dropped off screens):
 * Action: Exit or tighten stops immediately.
 * Why: Momentum has exhausted; the music stopped.
